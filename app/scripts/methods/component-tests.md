# Component Tests

## Wikipedia

The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units
The data being passed can be considered as "message packets" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit.
