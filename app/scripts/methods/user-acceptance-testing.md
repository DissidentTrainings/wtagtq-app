# User Acceptance Testing

## Wikipedia

User acceptance testing (UAT) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user.[2] It is not system testing (ensuring software does not crash and meets documented requirements), but rather ensures that the solution will work for the user i.e. test the user accepts the solution (software vendors often refer to this as "Beta testing").

This testing should be undertaken by a subject-matter expert (SME), preferably the owner or client of the solution under test, and provide a summary of the findings for confirmation to proceed after trial or review. In software development, UAT as one of the final stages of a project often occurs before a client or customer accepts the new system. Users of the system perform tests in line with what would occur in real-life scenarios.[3]
