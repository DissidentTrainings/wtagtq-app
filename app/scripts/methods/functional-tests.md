# Functional Tests

## Wikipedia

Functional testing is a quality assurance (QA) process[1] and a type of black box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (not like in white-box testing).[2] Functional testing usually describes what the system does.

Functional testing does not imply that you are testing a function (method) of your module or class. Functional testing tests a slice of functionality of the whole system.
